## üí° DEVELOPMENT BEST PRACTICES

1. **Asset-Driven**: Search before creating
2. **UI Workflow**: Design in React ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Import
3. **Physics-First**: 2D drives gameplay, 3D is cosmetic
4. **Performance**: Profile early and often
5. **Version Control**: Commit after major features

---

## üóëÔ∏è HOUSEKEEPING REMINDER

**IMPORTANT**: Throughout development, DELETE unnecessary .md files to prevent context clogging.

### Files to Keep
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN_V3.md` (this file)
- `README.md`
- `ASSET_INVENTORY.md`

### Files to Delete After Use
- Old development plans (V1, V2)
- Temporary research notes
- Obsolete documentation
- Duplicate planning files

**Clean context = Better AI assistance = Faster development**

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Ready to Execute
**Next Action**: Begin Week 0 - UI Foundation Setup

*Follow the plan. Ship the game.* üöÄ
