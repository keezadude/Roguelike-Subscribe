## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Testing)

### CRITICAL #1: Wrong main.lua Running
**Location:** `main.lua:1-219`  
**Problem:** The game is currently set to run the OLD Week 0 library test, not the integrated game  
**Evidence:**
```lua
-- main.lua line 4:
print("Starting Dismount Roguelike Library Test...")
```
**Impact:** Running the game will load the library test instead of the actual game  
**Fix Required:**
1. Either rename `main_integrated.lua` to `main.lua`
2. Or update run scripts to use `main_integrated.lua`
3. Archive old `main.lua` as `main_library_test.lua`

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Game won't run at all  
**Time to Fix:** 2 minutes  
**Confidence:** 100%

---

### CRITICAL #2: Shop UI Has No Click Handling
**Location:** `src/ui/shop-ui.lua:330-340`  
**Problem:** The shop can be VIEWED but items cannot be PURCHASED  
**Evidence:**
```lua
function ShopUI:getItemAtPosition(mouseX, mouseY)
    -- Simplified - would need proper bounds checking
    return nil  -- ‚Üê ALWAYS returns nil!
end
```
**Impact:** Users cannot buy anything in the shop - system is non-functional  
**Additional Issue:** SHOP state in game-manager.lua (lines 160-176) has NO `mousepressed` callback  
**Fix Required:**
1. Implement `ShopUI:getItemAtPosition()` with actual bounds checking
2. Add `ShopUI:mousepressed(x, y, button)` method
3. Add `mousepressed` callback to SHOP state in game-manager
4. Wire up purchase logic

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Shop is completely non-functional  
**Time to Fix:** 2-3 hours  
**Confidence:** 100%

---

### CRITICAL #3: Three UI Systems Not Integrated
**Location:** Multiple files  
**Problem:** Three complete UI systems exist but are NEVER imported or used  

| File | Lines | Status | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `src/ui/main-menu.lua` | 151 | Exists, never imported | Main menu uses basic print statements instead |
| `src/ui/menu-manager.lua` | 252 | Exists, never imported | Menu system not used |
| `src/ui/statistics-ui.lua` | 354 | Exists, never imported | No stats screen accessible |

**Evidence:** `game-manager.lua` lines 5-23 show ALL requires - these three are missing  
**Impact:** 
- Main menu is using placeholder text (lines 620-633 of game-manager.lua)
- No statistics/progress screen exists despite having a full implementation
- MenuManager features (button animations, hover effects) not available

**Severity:** HIGH - Major UX degradation  
**Time to Fix:** 4-6 hours to integrate all three  
**Confidence:** 100%

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### HIGH #1: No Save Files = Never Tested
**Location:** Project root directory  
**Problem:** No `.sav`, `.json`, or save files exist anywhere  
**Impact:** Game has NEVER been successfully run to completion  
**Evidence:** Search for `*.sav`, `savegame*`, `save_data.json` found 0 results  
**Recommendation:** After fixing Critical issues, run full game loop to verify save system works

**Severity:** HIGH - No evidence of successful testing  
**Time to Verify:** N/A (test after fixes)  
**Confidence:** 100%

---

### HIGH #2: Assets Loader Has Placeholder Fallbacks
**Location:** `src/ui/assets-loader.lua:143-147`  
**Problem:** UI will use placeholder graphics even if exports fail  
**Evidence:**
```lua
print("‚úÖ Game will use placeholder graphics until sprites are exported")
```
**Impact:** Users won't know if sprites are missing - game will look unfinished  
**Recommendation:** Make this more obvious (warning banner in-game)

**Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH - UX issue  
**Time to Fix:** 1 hour  
**Confidence:** 100%

---

## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### MEDIUM #1: Stub Functions Remain
**Location:** Multiple files  
**Problem:** Several functions have TODOs or incomplete implementations  

| File | Line | Issue |
|------|------|-------|
| `src/ui/main-menu.lua` | 20 | TODO: Load button sprites |
| `src/ui/main-menu.lua` | 56 | TODO: Transition to game state |
| `src/progression/achievement-system.lua` | 498-500 | Placeholder Steam SDK integration |
| `src/ui/shop-ui.lua` | 338 | Simplified bounds checking (stub) |
| `src/audio/sound-manager.lua` | 134, 349 | Placeholder sound system |

**Impact:** Features exist but may not work correctly  
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Functionality degraded  
**Time to Fix:** Variable, 30 min - 2 hours each  
**Confidence:** 95%

---

### MEDIUM #2: Placeholder Comments Throughout
**Location:** Multiple entity files  
**Problem:** Entities use "placeholder representation" instead of real graphics  

| File | Line | Comment |
|------|------|---------|
| `src/entities/vehicle.lua` | 306 | "Draw the vehicle (2D placeholder representation)" |
| `src/entities/ragdoll.lua` | 255 | "Draw ragdoll (2D placeholder representation)" |
| `src/entities/player.lua` | 125 | "Draw the player (placeholder graphics)" |
| `src/rendering/model-loader.lua` | 119-130 | `createPlaceholderModel()` function |

**Impact:** Game will look unfinished, but technically functional  
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Visual issue  
**Time to Fix:** Depends on asset creation (outside code scope)  
**Confidence:** 100%

---

### MEDIUM #3: Menu Manager Uses Slab UI (Not Imported Globally)
**Location:** `src/ui/menu-manager.lua:5`  
**Problem:** Requires Slab UI library but game-manager doesn't use it  
**Evidence:**
```lua
local Slab = require('lib.Slab')
```
**Impact:** If menu-manager is integrated later, Slab would need initialization  
**Current Status:** Safe (module not used), but will break if integrated  
**Recommendation:** Either remove Slab dependency or initialize in main_integrated.lua

**Severity:** MEDIUM - Future integration blocker  
**Time to Fix:** 1-2 hours  
**Confidence:** 90%

---

## üü¢ LOW PRIORITY ISSUES

### LOW #1: Apologetic Comments
**Location:** `src/ui/shop-ui.lua:338`  
**Problem:** Code has apologetic comment "Simplified - would need proper bounds checking"  
**Impact:** None (we already know it's broken from Critical #2)  
**Recommendation:** Remove comment when fixing

**Severity:** LOW - Documentation issue  
**Confidence:** 100%

---

### LOW #2: Unused Library Test Code
**Location:** `main.lua` (all 219 lines)  
**Problem:** Entire file is deprecated test code  
**Impact:** Clutters codebase, may confuse developers  
**Recommendation:** Archive to `tests/` or `archive/` folder

**Severity:** LOW - Organizational issue  
**Time to Fix:** 2 minutes  
**Confidence:** 100%

---

### LOW #3: Debug Print Statements in Production Code
**Location:** Throughout codebase  
**Problem:** Extensive use of print() for debug output  
**Evidence:** Dozens of prints in game-manager, collision handlers, etc.  
**Impact:** Console spam, minor performance hit  
**Recommendation:** Keep for now (useful for testing), add debug flag later

**Severity:** LOW - Performance/UX polish  
**Time to Fix:** 2-3 hours to add debug flag system  
**Confidence:** 100%

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS (Prioritized)

1. **FIX CRITICAL #1** (2 min): Point game to correct main.lua
2. **FIX CRITICAL #2** (2-3 hrs): Implement shop click handling
3. **TEST GAME** (30 min): Run complete loop, verify save system
4. **FIX CRITICAL #3** (4-6 hrs): Integrate UI systems OR accept basic UI
5. **ADDRESS HIGH ISSUES** (as needed): Verify asset loading
6. **POLISH** (optional): Fix medium/low issues

**Estimated Time to Testable:** 2.5-6 hours (depending on UI integration decision)  
**Estimated Time to Shippable:** 10-15 hours (with all fixes + polish)

---

## üèÅ CAN THIS GAME RUN RIGHT NOW?

**Answer:** ‚ùå **NO** - Critical issues prevent basic functionality

**Blocking Issues:**
1. Wrong main.lua file will run library test instead of game
2. Shop is completely non-functional (can't make purchases)
3. No evidence of successful testing (no save files)

**After Critical Fixes:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **YES (Basic)** - Game will run but with degraded UX

**With All Fixes:** ‚úÖ **YES (Full)** - Game will be fully functional

**Confidence Level:** Very High (95%)
