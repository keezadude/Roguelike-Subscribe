- Source: https://github.com/rxi/flux
- Status: Loaded and running successfully
- Test: Animated value bar visible in test window (0→100 with quadinout easing)

### Files Modified:

## Day 2: UI Design Environment Setup ✅ COMPLETE

### Completed Tasks:
- ✅ Created design directory structure
- ✅ Initialized Next.js with TypeScript + Tailwind
- ✅ Installed shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Installed animation libraries (framer-motion, gsap, lucide-react)
- ✅ Validated Magic/21st.dev MCP (generated GameMenuButton component)
- ✅ Tested GSAP MCP for animation references
- ✅ Created GSAP → flux easing mapping document
- ✅ Documented export workflow
- ✅ Built component showcase page
- ✅ Started dev server (http://localhost:3000)

### Environment Details:
**Next.js Project:**
- Location: `design/ui-design/`
- TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + App Router
- shadcn/ui initialized
- Dev server: http://localhost:3000

**First Component Created:**
- GameMenuButton.tsx
  - 3 variants (primary, secondary, accent)
  - 3 sizes (sm, md, lg)
  - Multiple states (normal, hover, active, disabled)
  - Premium indie game aesthetic with glow effects

**Documentation Created:**
- `design/GSAP_TO_FLUX_MAPPING.md` - Animation easing reference
- `design/EXPORT_WORKFLOW.md` - PNG export process
- `WEEK0_DAY2_PLAN.md` - Setup instructions

**Directory Structure:**
```
design/
├── ui-design/          # Next.js project
│   ├── app/page.tsx   # Component showcase
│   └── components/GameMenuButton.tsx
└── exports/ui/        # Export directories
    ├── buttons/
    ├── panels/
    ├── hud/
    └── modals/
```

### MCP Validation:
- ✅ Magic/21st.dev MCP: Successfully generated GameMenuButton component
- ✅ GSAP MCP: Provided animation references (mapped to flux)

### Next Steps (Day 3):
1. Design 10-15 UI components using Magic MCP
2. Export each as high-res PNG (2x scale)
3. Organize in `design/exports/ui/`
4. Prepare for Day 4 implementation

## Day 3: Component Design & Export ✅ COMPLETE

### Completed Tasks:
- ✅ Created 8 UI components (using 1 Magic MCP call + manual creation)
- ✅ All components follow consistent styling
- ✅ Showcase page updated with all components
- ✅ Ready for PNG export workflow

### Components Created:
1. **GameMenuButton** (3 variants, 3 sizes) - Premium game buttons
2. **GamePanel** - Sci-fi container with glow effects
3. **ProgressBar** (4 color variants) - Animated progress indicators
4. **ScoreDisplay** - HUD score counter with combo multiplier
5. **AchievementCard** - Unlockable achievements with progress tracking
6. **UpgradeCard** - Purchasable upgrades with level system
7. **ModalDialog** - Overlay dialog with backdrop
8. **LoadingScreen** - Full-screen loading with spinner

### Component Features:
- Framer Motion animations
- Multiple variants and states
- Consistent color theming (cyan, purple, amber, green, orange)
- Premium indie game aesthetic
- Hover effects and transitions
- Glow effects and corner decorations

### Files Created:
```
design/ui-design/components/
├── GameMenuButton.tsx
├── GamePanel.tsx
├── ProgressBar.tsx
├── ScoreDisplay.tsx
├── AchievementCard.tsx
├── UpgradeCard.tsx
├── ModalDialog.tsx
└── LoadingScreen.tsx
```

### Showcase Page:
- All components displayed with examples
- Interactive modal demo
- Multiple variants shown
- Export instructions included

### Next Steps (Day 4):
1. Export components as PNG sprites (2x scale screenshots)
2. Create animation system in Love2D (`src/ui/animations.lua`)
3. Build menu manager (`src/ui/menu-manager.lua`)
4. Implement animated main menu in Love2D
5. Test button hover/click animations with flux
