```

**Total:** ~1,850 lines of testing infrastructure

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Three Testing Modes

| Shortcut | Mode | Duration | Use Case |
|----------|------|----------|----------|
| **F2** | Quick Check | Instant | Quick validation during development |
| **F3** | Single Test | 10 seconds | Monitor specific run |
| **F4** | Full Suite | 10s × tests | Pre-commit validation |

### 2. Automatic Detection

The system automatically detects:

✅ **Spawn Validation**
- Vehicle spawns between Y=500 and Y=700
- Within 200px of ground level
- Not overlapping with ground

✅ **Runtime Monitoring**
- Y position stays within -100 to 800
- No sudden Y jumps (physics glitches)
- Velocity stays reasonable (< 5000 px/s)

✅ **Violation Tracking**
- Records exact time of violation
- Captures position data
- Generates detailed reports

### 3. Visual Feedback

When tests run, you see:
```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│ 🧪 AUTOMATED TEST RUNNING  │
│ Test: Position Validation  │
│ Time: 3.5s / 10.0s        │
│ Samples: 35               │
│ Status: PASS              │
└────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. Console Reporting

```
=== Starting Vehicle Position Test: Manual Test ===
📍 Initial spawn position: (100.0, 630.0)
📏 Ground reference: Y = 700.0

[10 seconds of monitoring...]

✅ No violations detected!

=== Test Complete: Manual Test [PASSED] ===
Duration: 10.00s
Samples: 100
Violations: 0

📊 Position Trace (every 1s):
Time(s) | X Position | Y Position | Speed
--------|------------|------------|-------
   0.00 |      100.0 |      630.0 |    0.0
   1.00 |      245.3 |      645.2 |  156.3
   [...]
```

## 🚀 Immediate Usage

### Right Now - Test Your Current Setup

1. **Launch the game** (it should already be running)
2. **Start a run** (SPACE at menu, then SPACE to launch)
3. **Press F3** to start automated test
4. **Watch console** for results

### Expected Output

If everything is working:
```
✅ Quick Check PASSED: Vehicle at Y=630.0
✅ No violations detected!
[PASSED]
```

If there's a problem:
```
❌ VIOLATION [FELL_THROUGH_GROUND]: Vehicle fell below ground: 
   Y=815.3 at t=3.45s (max: 800.0)
[FAILED]
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Default Thresholds (Tuned to Your Game)

```lua
-- In tests/vehicle-position-test.lua
CONFIG = {
    MAX_ACCEPTABLE_Y = 800,        -- Max Y before "fell through"
    MIN_ACCEPTABLE_Y = -100,       -- Min Y before "flew off"
    EXPECTED_SPAWN_Y_MIN = 500,    -- Spawn range min
    EXPECTED_SPAWN_Y_MAX = 700,    -- Spawn range max
    GROUND_Y = 700,                -- Ground position
    TEST_DURATION = 10.0,          -- Test length
    SAMPLE_RATE = 0.1,             -- Sample every 0.1s
}
```

These values are already set to match your current game setup:
- Screen height: 720px
- Ground Y: 700px (720 - 20)
- Spawn Y: 630px (calculated from game-manager.lua)

## 📊 Violation Types Explained

| Code | Trigger | Likely Cause | Fix |
|------|---------|--------------|-----|
| **SPAWN_TOO_HIGH** | Y < 500 | Vehicle spawned above ramp | Adjust spawn Y in `game-manager.lua:322` |
| **SPAWN_TOO_LOW** | Y > 700 | Vehicle spawned in/below ground | Check collision on spawn |
| **FELL_THROUGH_GROUND** | Y > 800 during play | Physics collision bug | Check wall collision filter |
| **FLEW_OFF_TOP** | Y < -100 during play | Too much upward force | Reduce launch lift force |
| **PHYSICS_GLITCH** | Y velocity > 5000 | Physics engine error | Check timestep, body creation |

## 💡 Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Pre-Commit Check
```
1. Make code changes
2. Start game
3. Press F4 (full suite)
4. Verify all tests pass
5. Commit if green ✅
```

### Pattern 2: Quick Debug Check
```
1. Notice vehicle behavior seems off
2. Press F2 (instant check)
3. See if Y position is acceptable
4. Investigate if failed ❌
```

### Pattern 3: Regression Testing
```
1. Change physics settings
2. Run game
3. Press F3 (single test)
4. Compare results to baseline
5. Adjust settings if needed
```

### Pattern 4: CI/CD Integration
```lua
-- In CI pipeline
love.exe . --test
-- Check exit code
-- Parse console output
-- Report to build system
```

## 🎓 Understanding the Results

### Good Run Example
```
Initial: Y=630.0
t=0.0s:  Y=630.0, Speed=0     (at rest)
t=1.0s:  Y=645.0, Speed=156   (launched)
t=2.0s:  Y=658.0, Speed=201   (moving)
t=5.0s:  Y=698.0, Speed=34    (slowing)
t=8.0s:  Y=699.5, Speed=2     (stopped)
```
✅ Vehicle stayed in range, normal progression

### Bad Run Example
```
Initial: Y=630.0
t=0.0s:  Y=630.0, Speed=0
t=1.0s:  Y=645.0, Speed=156
t=2.5s:  Y=825.0, Speed=421   ← PROBLEM!
```
❌ Y jumped from 658 to 825 - fell through ground

## 🔍 Debugging Failed Tests

### Step-by-Step Investigation

1. **Check Violation Type**
   ```
   ❌ VIOLATION [FELL_THROUGH_GROUND]
   ```

2. **Find Time of Violation**
   ```
   at t=3.45s
   ```

3. **Look at Position Trace**
   ```
   t=3.0s: Y=658.0
   t=3.5s: Y=825.0  ← Jump of 167px
   ```

4. **Check Relevant Code**
   - For spawn issues → `game-manager.lua:setupRun()`
   - For ground issues → `game-manager.lua:createEnvironment()`
   - For physics issues → `physics/world.lua:update()`

5. **Verify Collision Filters**
   ```lua
   -- In vehicle.lua and wall.lua
   category = "WALL"  -- Both should collide
   ```

## 📈 Integration Points

### In Your Code

The test system hooks into:

```lua
-- game-manager.lua
function GameManager:update(dt)
    -- Your existing code...
    
    -- Test system automatically updates
    if self.testRunner and self.testMode then
        self.testRunner:update(dt)
    end
end

function GameManager:draw()
    -- Your existing code...
    
    -- Test overlay automatically draws
    if self.testRunner and self.testMode then
        self.testRunner:draw()
    end
end

function GameManager:keypressed(key)
    -- F2, F3, F4 automatically handled
    -- Your other keys still work normally
end
```

**Zero impact on gameplay** when not testing!
