## 📊 Progression Math

### Score to Subscribers Conversion
```lua
Base: 10 score = 1 subscriber

With upgrades:
- Monetization Lv5: +125% subscribers
- Verified Badge: +50% subscribers

Example:
Score: 10,000
Base subs: 1,000
With maxed upgrades: 1,000 × 2.25 × 1.5 = 3,375 subscribers!
```

### Upgrade Costs
```lua
Cost = baseCost × (multiplier ^ currentLevel)

Viral Boost:
- Level 1: 100 subs
- Level 2: 150 subs
- Level 3: 225 subs
- Level 4: 337 subs
- Level 5: 506 subs
Total for max: 1,318 subscribers
```

## 🔄 Save System

### What Gets Saved
- Total subscribers (currency)
- Total runs, total score, high score
- Unlocked characters, trucks, levels
- All upgrade levels
- Statistics (damage, hits, combos, headshots)
- Settings (volume, debug mode)

### Save Location
```
[Love2D Save Directory]/save_data.json

## ⚠️ What Still Needs Work

### High Priority
1. **Shop UI** - Currently just placeholder text
   - Need grid of upgrade cards
   - Need unlock cards
   - Need purchase confirmations

2. **Character/Truck Selection** - Not implemented
   - Need selection screens
   - Need visual previews
   - Currently always uses default

3. **Multiple Levels** - Only one arena exists
   - Need to create different level layouts
   - Need level selection screen

4. **UI Sprite Integration** - Still using placeholders
   - Export React components to PNG
   - Replace placeholder graphics
   - Add UI animations with flux

### Medium Priority
1. **Audio Files** - System ready but no sounds
   - Download impact sounds
   - Download music tracks
   - Integrate with SoundManager

2. **3D Rendering** - Infrastructure exists but untested
   - Download test 3D model
   - Test 3DreamEngine integration
   - Verify 2D→3D sync

3. **Polish**
   - Camera shake on impacts
   - Particle effects
   - Screen flash effects
   - Smooth transitions

### Low Priority
1. **Achievements UI** - Stats tracked but no display
2. **Leaderboards** - Local high scores
3. **Controller Support** - Keyboard only currently
4. **Settings Menu** - Volume controls exist but no UI

## 💡 Tips for Development

### Adding New Upgrades
```lua
-- In progression-manager.lua UPGRADES table
new_upgrade = {
    name = "Upgrade Name",
    description = "What it does",
    icon = "🎯",
    maxLevel = 5,
    baseCost = 100,
    costMultiplier = 1.5,
    effect = function(level) 
        return 1 + (level * 0.10)  -- +10% per level
    end
}
```

### Adding New Unlockables
```lua
-- In progression-manager.lua UNLOCKABLES table
characters = {
    new_char = {
        name = "Character Name",
        cost = 1000,
        description = "Special trait"
    }
}
```

### Creating New Levels
```lua
-- In game-manager.lua createEnvironment()
if currentLevel == "new_level" then
    -- Create walls, platforms, obstacles
    -- Position ragdolls
    -- Set up unique layout
end
```
