## üêõ CRITICAL BUG FIXES (COMPLETED)

### 1. Save System Spam
**Problem:** Game saved 10+ times in a row after unlocking achievements

**Solution:**
- Removed individual save calls from `AchievementSystem:unlock()`
- Added single batch save in `GameManager:calculateResults()`
- Save only executes once after all achievements processed

**Performance Gain:** 10x reduction in file I/O operations

**Files:**
- `src/progression/achievement-system.lua`
- `src/game/game-manager.lua`

---

### 2. Debug Console Spam
**Problem:** 18+ debug messages every setup phase, continuous spam during gameplay

**Solution:**
- Added `debugMode` flag to `PhysicsWorld` and `GameManager`
- Wrapped all debug prints in conditional checks
- Debug messages only appear when explicitly enabled

**Messages Silenced:**
- Collision filter setup (18 messages ‚Üí 0)
- Collision callbacks setup (1 message ‚Üí 0)
- Damage calculation prints (per hit ‚Üí 0)
- Damage result prints (per hit ‚Üí 0)

**To Enable:** `gameManager.debugMode = true`

**Files:**
- `src/physics/world.lua`
- `src/game/game-manager.lua`

---

### 3. Damage Always Capping at 500
**Problem:** All hits showed maximum damage, no variety

**Solution:**
- Rebalanced damage calculation formula
- Adjusted thresholds to create meaningful ranges
- Body part multipliers now impactful

**Results:** See "Balance Tuning - Damage Variation" above

**File:** `src/systems/damage-calculator.lua`

---
