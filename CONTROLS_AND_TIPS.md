## 💡 Tips for Success

### Launch Strategy

2. **Watch the ramp** - Vehicle launches from the ramp automatically
3. **Let physics do the work** - No mid-air control needed

### Scoring Points
- **Hit ragdolls** - Collisions deal damage and award points
- **Headshots** - 15x damage multiplier! Aim for heads
- **Build combos** - Hit multiple ragdolls in sequence
- **Higher speed = more damage** - Fast impacts score big

### Understanding Damage
- **Torso hits**: 8x multiplier (good)
- **Head hits**: 15x multiplier (excellent!)  
- **Arm hits**: 3x multiplier (weak)
- **Leg hits**: 5x multiplier (okay)

### Progression System
- **Earn subscribers** - Based on your score
- **Unlock achievements** - Various gameplay milestones
- **Buy upgrades** - Spend subscribers in the shop
  - Algorithm Boost (more subscribers per point)
  - Monetization (passive subscriber income)

  - Verified Badge (unlock at milestones)

## 🎯 Current Game Balance

### What Changed
The game was completely unplayable before. Here's what's fixed:

✅ **Collisions actually work** - You'll score points now!
✅ **Better positioning** - Ragdolls are in your path
✅ **Longer runs** - Minimum 5 seconds of gameplay
✅ **More damage** - Hits feel impactful

- Earn 500-3,000 subscribers
- Run lasts 8-15 seconds

## 🐛 Debug Info

### Debug View (F1)
Shows:
- Physics bodies (wireframes)
- Body count
- FPS and update time
- Useful for understanding collisions

### Console Output
The game prints to console:
- Launch power and force
- Collision detection ("HIT!")
- Damage calculations
- Score updates
- Achievement unlocks

Look for: `"HIT! [bodypart] for [damage] damage, +[score] points"`

## 🎪 Known Quirks

1. **Sometimes ragdolls fly off-screen** - That's intended! Ragdoll physics are chaotic
2. **Occasional zero-score runs** - If you miss all ragdolls (rare now)
3. **Vehicle can flip** - Physics are realistic, sometimes you land upside-down
4. **Slow-motion on big hits** - Feature, not a bug! Dramatic effect

## 🚀 Advanced Techniques

### The Perfect Launch
1. Charge to 95-100%
2. Release precisely
3. Watch vehicle arc over ramp
4. Impact first ragdoll at peak speed

### Combo Building  
- Hit ragdoll 1 → Combo x1
- Quickly hit ragdoll 2 → Combo x2
- Chain hit ragdoll 3 → Combo x3
- Each combo level multiplies score!

### Shop Strategy
- **Early game**: Focus on Algorithm Boost (more subs per run)
- **Mid game**: Get Viral Boost (bigger combos)
- **Late game**: Max out Monetization (passive income)
