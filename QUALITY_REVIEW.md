# Quality Review: Weeks 0-3 Assessment

## üéØ Project Goal Alignment Check

**Project Goal**: "Truck Dismount-inspired physics destruction game with roguelike progression and modern UI"

**Target**: $10 Premium Indie Game for Steam

---

## üìã Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working Well

**Week 1: Physics Foundation**
- ‚úÖ Excellent physics world system
- ‚úÖ Clean entity architecture
- ‚úÖ Debug visualization complete
- ‚úÖ Player movement solid (though not needed for truck game)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue**: Built a "player" entity but this is a truck dismount game

**Week 2: Ragdoll & 3D**
- ‚úÖ Multi-body ragdoll physics working
- ‚úÖ Joint system realistic
- ‚úÖ Damage multipliers implemented
- ‚úÖ 3D integration infrastructure ready
- ‚úÖ Asset download guide complete

**Week 3: Vehicle & Damage**
- ‚úÖ Vehicle physics excellent
- ‚úÖ Damage calculation sophisticated
- ‚úÖ Score system with combos
- ‚úÖ Audio system ready
- ‚úÖ UI components polished
- ‚úÖ Complete gameplay loop

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Gaps Identified

**1. Main Game Integration (CRITICAL)**
- **Issue**: `main.lua` is still just a library test
- **Impact**: Individual test files work, but no integrated game
- **Required**: Unified main game that uses all systems

**2. UI Component Export (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Issue**: Week 0 created React components but they're not exported as sprites
- **Impact**: Game has placeholder graphics instead of designed UI
- **Required**: Export components from Next.js to PNG sprites

**3. Roguelike Progression (MISSING)**
- **Issue**: Game has no roguelike elements yet
- **Impact**: Half of the core concept ("& Subscribe") not implemented
- **Required**: 
  - Run-based progression
  - Unlock system
  - Meta-progression currency
  - Upgrade shop

**4. 3D Rendering (NOT TESTED)**
- **Issue**: 3DreamEngine infrastructure exists but never actually tested
- **Impact**: Can't verify 3D rendering works
- **Required**: Test 3D model loading and rendering

**5. Menu System (INCOMPLETE)**
- **Issue**: Menu manager exists but not used in actual game
- **Impact**: No main menu, pause menu not integrated
- **Required**: Implement full menu flow

---

## üîß Required Improvements

### Priority 1: Game Integration (IMMEDIATE)

**Create Integrated Main Game**:
```lua
-- main.lua should have:
1. Game state machine (Menu ‚Üí Setup ‚Üí Launch ‚Üí Gameplay ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Shop)
2. Menu system integration
3. All Week 1-3 systems working together
4. Proper initialization order
5. Save/load system
```

**Files to Create**:
- `src/game/game-manager.lua` - Central game coordinator
- `src/game/state-machine.lua` - Game state management
- `src/game/save-manager.lua` - Persistence system
- New `main.lua` - Actual game entry point

### Priority 2: UI Integration (HIGH)

**Export UI Components**:
1. Run Next.js dev server
2. Screenshot each component at 2x resolution
3. Save to `assets/images/ui/`
4. Update UI code to use sprites instead of placeholders

**Components to Export**:
- Main menu buttons
- Score display
- Launch control (styled version)
- Results panel
- Achievement cards
- Upgrade cards
- Modal dialogs

### Priority 3: Roguelike Systems (HIGH)

**Implement Core Roguelike Features**:
```lua
-- src/progression/currency-manager.lua
-- src/progression/unlock-manager.lua
-- src/progression/upgrade-system.lua
-- src/progression/meta-progression.lua
```

**Features Needed**:
- Currency earned from runs (based on score)
- Permanent upgrades (truck upgrades, ragdoll unlocks)
- Unlock tiers (new trucks, characters, levels)
- Meta-progression (subscriber count as currency theme)

### Priority 4: Menu Flow (MEDIUM)

**Implement Full Menu System**:
1. Main menu (Start, Continue, Options, Quit)
2. Character select (choose ragdoll character)
3. Truck select (choose vehicle)
4. Upgrade shop (spend currency)
5. Pause menu (during gameplay)
6. Results screen (already exists, needs integration)

### Priority 5: Polish & Testing (MEDIUM)

**Test All Systems Together**:
- Ensure no conflicts between systems
- Verify performance with all systems active
- Test save/load
- Test progression flow

## üéØ Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Integration (Immediate - 2-3 hours)
1. Create unified `main.lua` with game state machine
2. Integrate all Week 1-3 systems
3. Add basic menu flow
4. Test complete gameplay loop

### Phase 2: Roguelike Core (High Priority - 4-5 hours)
1. Currency system (subscriber count theme)
2. Upgrade shop
3. Save/load system
4. Meta-progression tracking

### Phase 3: UI Polish (High Priority - 2-3 hours)
1. Export React components to sprites
2. Replace placeholder graphics
3. Integrate designed UI elements
4. Add UI animations (using flux)

### Phase 4: 3D Testing (Medium Priority - 1-2 hours)
1. Download test 3D model
2. Test 3DreamEngine integration
3. Verify 2D‚Üí3D sync works
4. Add 3D rendering to gameplay

### Phase 5: Content & Polish (Medium Priority - 3-4 hours)
1. Download audio files
2. Add sound effects
3. Add background music
4. Polish transitions

---

## üö® Breaking Changes Needed

### 1. Remove Week 1 Player Entity
**Reason**: This is a truck game, not a player-controlled game
**Action**: Player.lua can be archived or repurposed for future use
**Impact**: Minimal - not used in core gameplay

### 2. Restructure main.lua
**Reason**: Current file is just library test
**Action**: Create proper game entry point
**Impact**: High - core change but necessary

### 3. Add State Management
**Reason**: No game flow currently exists
**Action**: Create GameManager and StateMachine
**Impact**: High - enables actual game

---

## üí° Alignment Recommendations

### Theme Integration: "Roguelike & Subscribe"

**"Subscribe" Theme Ideas**:
1. **Currency = Subscribers**: Earn subscribers instead of generic points
2. **Upgrades = Viral Boosts**: "Go Viral", "Trending Topic", "Algorithm Boost"
3. **Levels = Content Types**: "Short", "Long Form", "Live Stream"
4. **Characters = Content Creators**: Different creator types unlockable
5. **Achievements = Milestones**: "100K Subs", "Verified", "Monetized"

**Roguelike Elements to Add**:
1. **Run-based structure**: Each launch is a "video upload"
2. **Permanent upgrades**: Use subscribers to buy better trucks/equipment
3. **Unlockables**: New characters, trucks, levels
4. **Meta-progression**: Subscriber count persists between runs
5. **Random elements**: Random obstacle placement, varied levels
