# ✅ Ready for Week 4 - Final Quality Pass Complete

## 🎯 Second Quality Pass Results

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE AND APPROVED**

**Critical Bug Found & Fixed**: Collision detection was stubbed in game-manager.lua (now fully implemented)

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed (2nd Pass)

### Critical Issue: Collision Detection
**Problem**: `checkCollisions()` function in game-manager.lua was just a stub
**Impact**: Vehicle-ragdoll collisions wouldn't be detected
**Fix**: Implemented full collision detection with damage/score integration
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

### Implementation Added
```lua
- checkCollisions() - Now detects vehicle-ragdoll impacts
- handleVehicleRagdollCollision() - Processes damage and score
- Collision deduplication (prevents double-counting)
- Integration with damage calculator
- Integration with score manager
- Floating damage numbers
- Impact sounds
```
