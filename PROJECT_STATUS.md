## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Ready to Begin Phase 1: Core Physics Foundation**

1. **Immediate Action**: Start implementing `src/physics/world.lua`
2. **First Goal**: Stable physics world with debug visualization
3. **Timeline**: Week 1 completion target
4. **Success Criteria**: 60 FPS physics simulation

### **Development Command**
```bash
# Test current setup
run.bat

# Begin development
# Start with Phase 1 according to DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md
```

## 📊 **Progress Tracking**

## 🎮 **Vision Reminder**

**Goal**: Create a physics-based ragdoll destruction game combining Truck Dismount mechanics with roguelike progression, featuring both 2D and 3D rendering modes.

**First Form Target**: Playable MVP with truck launching ragdoll, damage calculation, scoring, and basic progression system.

**Timeline**: 6 weeks to first release
