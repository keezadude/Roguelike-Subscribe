# Roguelike & Subscribe - Critical Gameplay Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Broken Collision Detection** (Critical)
**Problem:** Only 1 out of 13 runs scored any points. Breezefield collision callbacks weren't firing consistently.

**Solutions Implemented:**
- **Dual Collision System**: Added both Breezefield callback-based detection AND manual proximity-based fallback
- **Wheel Collisions**: Vehicle wheels now also detect ragdoll collisions (not just chassis)
- **Cooldown System**: Prevents duplicate collision processing (0.1s cooldown per ragdoll)
- **Improved Callback Setup**: Callbacks set on both chassis and all 4 wheels

**Files Modified:**
- `src/game/game-manager.lua` - Lines 399-521 (setupCollisionCallbacks, checkCollisions)

### 2. **Poor Level Design** (Critical)
**Problem:** Vehicle launched from x=150 toward ragdolls at x=550-850 with no clear path. Ramp didn't aim at targets.

**Solutions Implemented:**
- **Repositioned Vehicle**: Moved from x=150 to x=100, positioned ON ramp
- **Repositioned Ragdolls**: Now spawn at x=350-710 in direct vehicle path
- **Better Ramp**: Steeper angle (-0.3 rad) and positioned to launch toward ragdolls
- **Longer Ground**: Extended to 4x screen width to prevent ragdolls falling off
- **Reduced Count**: 3 ragdolls instead of 5 for better performance and less clutter

**Files Modified:**
- `src/game/game-manager.lua` - Lines 296-372 (setupRun, createEnvironment)

### 3. **Premature Run Endings** (Critical)
**Problem:** Runs ended when speed < 10, which happened almost immediately, cutting gameplay short.

**Solutions Implemented:**
- **Minimum Run Time**: 5-second minimum before runs can end
- **Lower Speed Threshold**: Changed from 10 to 5 pixels/second
- **Stop Duration**: Must be stopped for 1.5 seconds before ending
- **Maximum Runtime**: 30-second auto-end to prevent infinite runs
- **Run Timer Tracking**: Proper time tracking in GAMEPLAY state

**Files Modified:**
- `src/game/game-manager.lua` - Lines 634-666 (checkRunEnd)

### 4. **Weak Launch Mechanics** (Major)
**Problem:** Vehicle launches felt underpowered and didn't create exciting gameplay.

**Solutions Implemented:**
- **50% Launch Force Boost**: Launch impulse multiplied by 1.5
- **Increased Lift**: Upward force increased from 0.2x to 0.3x for more dramatic arcs
- **Higher Max Speed**: 500 → 800 pixels/second
- **More Engine Power**: 150,000 → 200,000 force units

**Files Modified:**
- `src/entities/vehicle.lua` - Lines 26-28, 187-209

### 5. **Overly Strict Damage Calculation** (Major)
**Problem:** Damage thresholds too high, many collisions resulted in 0 damage.

**Solutions Implemented:**
- **Doubled Damage Scale**: 0.005 → 0.01 (100% more damage per hit)
- **Lower Velocity Threshold**: 10 → 5 pixels/second minimum
- **Lower Energy Threshold**: 100 → 50 Joules minimum
- **More Forgiving**: Easier to score damage on glancing hits

**Files Modified:**
- `src/systems/damage-calculator.lua` - Lines 10-15

### 6. **Performance Issues** (Major)
**Problem:** Too many physics bodies, excessive iterations causing lag.

**Solutions Implemented:**
- **Reduced Ragdoll Count**: 5 → 3 per run (40% reduction)
- **Optimized Physics**: Velocity iterations 8→6, Position iterations 3→2
- **Reduced Particles**: Max particles 1000→500
- **Faster Camera**: Improved follow speed (3.0→5.0) for smoother tracking
- **Better Spacing**: Ragdolls spaced 180px apart instead of 120px

**Files Modified:**
- `src/game/game-manager.lua` - Lines 107-108, 326-328
- `src/physics/world.lua` - Lines 45-46

## Technical Improvements

### Collision Detection Architecture
```lua
-- THREE-LAYER APPROACH:
1. Breezefield Chassis Callbacks (postSolve)
2. Breezefield Wheel Callbacks (postSolve)  
3. Manual Proximity Fallback (checkCollisions)
```

### Ragdoll Positioning Strategy
```
Vehicle:  x=100  (on ramp)
Ragdoll1: x=350  (in path)
Ragdoll2: x=530  (in path)
Ragdoll3: x=710  (in path)
Ramp:     x=150, angle=-0.3 rad (aims at ragdolls)
```

### Run Flow Improvements
```
Launch → 5s minimum gameplay → Check stop conditions → 1.5s stopped → Results
                                                     ↓
                                              30s max auto-end
```

## Expected Gameplay Impact

**Before Fixes:**
- 92% of runs scored 0 points
- Runs lasted 1-3 seconds
- No hits detected
- Boring, unplayable

**After Fixes:**
- Should score points on MOST runs
- Runs last 8-15 seconds
- Multiple hits per run expected
- Exciting truck-dismount action!

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Launch Test**: Verify vehicle launches with good speed and arc
2. **Collision Test**: Ensure hits register on ragdolls (watch for DEBUG output)
3. **Duration Test**: Runs should last 5+ seconds minimum
4. **Score Test**: Every hit should award points
5. **Performance Test**: Smooth 60fps gameplay (check with F1 debug)

## Additional Notes

- All debug messages left in place for monitoring
- Collision cooldowns prevent double-counting
- Manual fallback ensures no hits are missed
- Camera tracks vehicle smoothly at high speeds
- Ragdolls positioned for optimal collision likelihood
